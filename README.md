# emotes

Ever want to easily insert commonly used emojis that don't exist in Unicode ![:thonk:](thonk.png)? Or animated emojis? Or stickers on chat platforms
that don't support them?

Well, `emotes` will do that for you (when we finish programming it). It will be an API so you can insert these emojis easily without having to tediously search for them. Just `GET /thonk` instead of searching Google (or Bing or your favourite search engine). Or upload your own emojis. Or `emotes` will fetch your emote for you from one of our supported providers.

(coming soon)

Things `emotes` can do right now (not so much):

- [x] Display local emotes from the `emotes` directory
- [ ] Display emotes from an external source like Discord or Twitch
- [ ] Display user-uploaded emotes
- [ ] Simple user interface to wrap over the API
- [ ] Deployment and publicly accessible instance
